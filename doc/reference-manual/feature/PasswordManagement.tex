\subsection{Safety first}
\AMBETH is able to maintain user \& password management securely. There is not a single product or framework we know about which considers a comparable bunch of approaches dealing with password stealing by database attacks or account hacks even on a long-term perspective. Secrets have to be kept secret today as well as in 20 years!

See \prettyref{feature:Cryptography} for more details.

\subsection{Password History}

\inputjava{Assign new password to a user with \type{IPasswordUtil}}
	{jambeth-security-server/src/main/java/de/osthus/ambeth/security/IPasswordUtil.java}
	
A new password instance will be created and associated to the user as the new actual password. The old password will be moved to the user's password history: This way business rules can be applied to ensure that a user does not re-use his password(s).

Corresponding configuration:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \prettyref{configuration:SecurityLoginPasswordHistoryCount}
	\item \prettyref{configuration:SecurityLoginPasswordLifetime}
\end{itemize}
