\section{Merge Process}
\label{feature:MergeProcess}
The \type{Merge Process} of \AMBETH{} is the single holistic and generic approach to evaluate changes to an information model based on entities, properties and relations fast and without any development or maintenance effort for an application or a developer. The process is separated in multiple sequential parts which can even be splitted between systems. For Java as well as C\# clients based on \AMBETH{} it is possible to evaluate all necessary changes on property-level on client-side, transferring only the minimum necessary information in a single service call to the remote \AMBETH{} service. The \AMBETH{} service is able to transform this diffed information to the persistence-specific operations (e.g. SQL INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements) in a very very efficient manner. In the end this approach - though its generic algorithm - is in many cases even faster at runtime than any solution a developer might create for each specific client/server scenario.

Note that as one of the last steps of the \type{Merge Process} a \type{DataChangeEvent} is fired which is transparently handled by all relevant cache instances (1st level, 2nd level, transactional and committed cache instances). Please refer to \prettyref{feature:DataChange} for details about this processing. Additional information can be found with \prettyref{feature:CacheWalker} regarding the question which cache instances hold information for currently given entity instances.
