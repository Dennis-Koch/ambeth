\ClearAPI
Instantiationprocessor beans are defined by implementing the interface \type{de.osthus.ambeth.ioc.IBeanInstantiationProcessor} and are used in order to customize the instantiation process of a bean. In most cases this is helpful if you want to dynamically subclass by bytecode enhancement the bean type to change or extend its behavior.\newline
The benefit of bytecode enhancement over proxying for AOP relies in the fact that
\begin{itemize}
	\item it is very fast at invocation time (no reflection necessary, no CgLib interceptor)
	\item but much more important: it does not create another instance of a potential abstract class which potentially unwanted behavior. As an outcome of the instantiationprocessor a single instance of a bytecode enhanced subclass of the target bean declaration is created. So it is not possible to circumvent any bytecode whereas an AOP proxy can be circumvented with reflection.
\end{itemize}
