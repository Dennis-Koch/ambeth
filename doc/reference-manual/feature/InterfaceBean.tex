\AMBETH{} supports the registration of interfaces as beans to an IoC container. To make this possible a dynamic proxy is generated implementing the interface. This allows postprocessors (\prettyref{feature:BeanPostProcessor}) to further intercept the proxy and give him a reasonable behavior (e.g. via scanning for specific annotations on the proxied interface).

bcf.registerBean(MyAnnotatedInterface.class).autowireable(MyAnnotatedInterface.class);
