\ClearAPI
Postprocessor beans are defined by implementing the interface \type{com.koch.ambeth.ioc.IBeanPostProcessor} and are called for each bean after everything has been injected and the methods "afterPropertiesSet" and "afterStarted" were called if available. All available information at this point of initializing the container is given to the postprocessor. In most cases a postprocessor does not change the state of the target bean itself but rather encapsulated the target bean with a proxy bean to implement AOP (aspect oriented patterns). Another major usecase is a bean which is interested in ``observing'' the lifecycle of other beans - e.g. to eagerly register those beans by itself with or without the Ambeth Link-API (\prettyref{feature:Link}).
