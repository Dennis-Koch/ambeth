To allow Ambeth to maintain technical fields like ``CreatedBy'' \& ``UpdatedBy'' a user identifier is needed. The bean handling this information in the persistence module is \type{IContextProvider}. When a transaction is started the implementation of \type{IContextProvider} retrieves its information from \type{ISecurityContextHolder} of the security module.

The \type{ISecurityContextHolder]}-bean by itself does only provide this information if
\begin{itemize}
	\item User credentials have been provided for the current thread
	\item An authentication has been executed with these credentials in the current thread and an authorization handle is available before changing data via the \prettyref{feature:MergeProcess}
\end{itemize}

There are several recommended approaches to provide user credentials for the \type{ISecurityContextHolder}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item By HTTP Basic Auth
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Transparently extracted from a REST request if using \AMBETH{} managed services
		\end{itemize}
	\item By proving background jobs the corresponding credentials during configuration
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Transparently processed impersonization if using \AMBETH{} managed jobs. Please see \prettyref{feature:BackgroundTask} for details.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\tip{It is possible to change an existing authorization handle at runtime by re-authenticating within the same current thread. This even works within the same transaction if intended for specific multi-impersonization usecases. As a result changes implied by different merge process executions - optionally within the same transaction - will be annotated with different ``CreatedBy'' / ``UpdatedBy'' information.}
