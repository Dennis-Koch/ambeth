Ambeth Batch can be used to define workflow described in XML in order to combine various processing steps for an application.
An example could be an import workflow with different processing steps for a document.

A library of steps, implemented by the application, can be included and used in various workflows. The workflow files could be added to the application during run time. A code based definition for the workflow is also possible.
